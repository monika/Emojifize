Emojifize ðŸŽº
=================

I saw [someone on Twitter](https://twitter.com/simply_cima/status/1132509817354899456) asking for a way to paste text into a form and have that text uppercased and the clapping hand emoji added between each word. 

This takes it a step further to let you decide which emojis you'd like to emphasize your text with. You can add up to three!

To Do v1.0:
--------
- [x] add clear form action
- [x] add clap emoji as default
- [x] bookend text with emoji
- [x] allow sequential form submissions
- [x] add check that content exists in both inputs
- [ ] add check that only emojis in emoji input
- [x] add check that only text in text input
- [x] check accessibility
- [x] fix layout on smaller screens
- [ ] IE11 CSS support

To Do v1.1:
----------
- [ ] implement emoji picker
- [ ] more robust emoji detection in text area and emoji input via [emoji-regex](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex)
