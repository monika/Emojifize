Emojifizer ðŸŽº
=================

I saw someone on Twitter asking for a way to paste text into a form and have that text capitalized and the clapping hand emoji added between each word. 

This takes it a step further to let you decide which emojis you'd like to emphasize your text with. You can add up to three!

To Do:
--------
- [x] add clear form action
- [ ] implement emoji picker
- [ ] allow sequential form submissions
- [ ] add check that content exists in both inputs
- [ ] add check that only emojis in emoji input
- [ ] add check that only text in text input
- [ ] IE11 CSS support
